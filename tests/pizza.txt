Pizza originated in Naples, Italy, with the modern version, like the Margherita, dating back to the late 18th century. It’s a flatbread topped with ingredients like tomato sauce, cheese (often mozzarella), and various toppings, baked at high heat. The Margherita, created in 1889 for Queen Margherita, uses tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil to mimic the Italian flag’s colors. Today, pizza’s a global staple, with countless regional styles—New York’s thin, foldable slices; Chicago’s deep-dish; or Neapolitan’s soft, chewy crust. It’s versatile, customizable, and one of the world’s most popular foods, with billions of pizzas consumed annually. Fun fact: the U.S. alone has over 70,000 pizzerias.
